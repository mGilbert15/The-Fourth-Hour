# The-Fourth-Hour
My Honors Capstone Research Project for James Madison University (JMU) Undergraduate Degree. This repo includes the learning materials used in  my research project: A Pilot Study on the Impact of Teaching Assistant Led CS1 Study Sessions using Peer Instruction. The purpose of the study was to observe if a Lead TA (peer-run) study session program would be a beneÔ¨Åcial addition to the JMU Computer Science Program. This repository includes the slideshows and supplementary learning materials designed and used in the study. Materials utilize the teaching pedagogy Peer Instruction (PI) and are targeted towards a the James Madison University CS1 (Part 1) course taught using Java.
